MVC - Model, View, Controller

1. request made at browser
2. request received at router of rails app
3. request routed to appropriate action controller
4. action controller either renders a view template or communicates w/ model
5. model communicates with db
6. model sends back info to controller
7. controller renders view

Conventional expectations
- To set a route route, define @/config/routes.rb that points to a controller#action (ex. root 'pages#home')
* naming
- pages_controller > home(action) : rails expects views/pages/home.html.erb
* command
```
rails generate controller pages
```
-> generated controller/pages_controller & views/pages
